This is a well chosen key. The attacker should have no knowledge of how it was chosen, and of course, should have no access to it.
THis is the message to encrypt
However, one-time-pad has one weakness. The key should never be used again. In other words, this second encrypted message
and any further encrypted message makes the key weak and subject to attack.
In other words: when using one-time-pad encryption, you should only encrpyt one message per key.
